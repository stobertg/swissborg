Hello SwissBorg ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for taking to time to review my technical challange - I appreciate the time and consideration. You can view the tech challange at the link below, or obvisouly can clone it and run it locally.

<br/>ðŸ–¥ https://swissborg.vercel.app/

Tech used:
<br/>Nextjs
<br/>CoinGecko API
<br/>Chartjs
<br/>Stitches

<br/>One thing to note, since I'm using real data, is as I was working through the labels on donut chart, I felt that the current lockup was not going to work with the up-to-date data. Labels would overlap or look wonky from a design perspective - that is why I chose to move the legend to the bottom of the chart.
