Hello SwissBorg ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for taking the time to review my technical challenge - I appreciate the time and consideration. You can view the tech challenge at the link below, or obviously can clone it and run it locally.

<br/> ðŸ–¥ https://swissborg.vercel.app/

Tech used:
<br/>Nextjs
<br/>Vercel (JAMStack principles: local env (NextJs) > github > vercel > production)
<br/>CoinGecko API
<br/>Chartjs
<br/>Stitches
<br/>Theming
<br/>Animxyz
<br/>ESLint

<br/>One thing to note, since I'm using real data, is as I was working through the labels on the donut chart, I felt that the current layout was not going to work with the up-to-date data. Labels would overlap or look wonky from a design perspective - that is why I chose to move the legend to the bottom of the chart.
